    <h1> The beginning </h1>

    <p>I took mobile friendly websites because it is the next step in my journey to becoming a programmer. Learning to make websites work dynamically with mobile devices is essential in this day in age with a majority of the population owning smartphones. I plan to continue my work and move onto javascript, c++, c# and so on. There will be no stop to the knowledge that i will seek when it comes to programming and moving this world into a better future.</p>
